Welcome to the Generative Surveillance Application!

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
   - Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Load the Project**:
   - Open the entire project folder in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Locate the main script of the application (e.g., `main.py`).
   - Run the script using your terminal or code editor.

4. **Database Warning**:
   - On the first run, you may see a warning about the database not being found. This is normal for the first use, as no database exists yet. The application will create a new database automatically.

## Notes
- Ensure that your system has the necessary hardware (e.g., GPU) if you want to leverage faster processing for the CLIP model.
- For any issues, refer to the detailed documentation in `README.html`.

Enjoy using the Generative Surveillance Application!
